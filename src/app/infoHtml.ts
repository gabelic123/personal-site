		<h2>GARZON</h2>
		<p>Building a chatbot that helps restaurants retain customers, book reservations
		more efficiently, reduce wait staff, and automate ordering processes.  First iteration
		will allow users to get information on a restaurant and book reservations straight from
		their messaging app.  The following iterations will focus on streamlining the ordering 
		process at casual sit down restaurants.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>CHATBOT PHONE UI</h2>
		<p>An experiment to test the feasability of a messaged based UI phone.  It's an Android app
		that replaces the home screen with a chatbot.  Everything that you can do on your phone can be
		done or accessed through the chatbot.  I believe that voice and messaging based interfaces is the
		future of how we interact with tech.  This experiment provides a fun new way to interact with your
		phone.</p>

		<h2>SATUS</h2>

		meant to inspire and encourage entrepreneurship as a viable career option.

		Dallas, TX and is sponsored by Blackstone.</p>

		<h2>PERSONAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT ALEXA SKILL</h2>
		<p>During a fintech hackathon my team built an Alexa Skill to help first time personal investors.  
		You can ask Alexa how much money you have in your savings account, the stock price of a specific company,
		and how much money you could have potentially made had you invested some of your savings in the stock 
		market.  The Alexa Skill was targeted towards first time investors so that they can get an initial feel of
		how much money they can make or lose investing in specific stocks.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>PERSONAL WEBSITE</h2>
		<p>The website you're on now! Because I am not a designer by trade I wanted, I wanted to test my 
		design skills.  The goal was to create as minimalist a design as possible will still portraying a 
		fair representation of myself.  And this was the result! I hope you enjoy it.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>WII REMOTE CONTROLLED CAR</h2>
		<p>I am a huge fan of the Arduino microcontroller and found a great library 
		that connected to the accelerometer of the Wii nunchuck remote. I came up with the 
		idea of using the remote's accelerometer to control an r/c car.  The Arduino 
		provides power to the remote and the remote sends the coordinates to the Arduino. 
		The Arduino then completes the circuit of a specific direction on the r/c car's remote 
		based on the received coordinates.</p>
